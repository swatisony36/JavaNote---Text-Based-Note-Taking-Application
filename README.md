# JavaNote---Text-Based-Note-Taking-Application

Introduction:
JavaNote is a simple text-based note-taking application designed to help users create, organize, and manage their notes efficiently. With features like formatting, categorization, and basic search functionality, JavaNote provides a user-friendly interface for maintaining digital notes. This project is an excellent opportunity to practice Java programming and GUI development skills.

Key Features:
 

User Authentication: Users can create accounts or log in securely to access their notes.

Note Creation and Editing: Users can create new notes, edit existing ones, and apply basic formatting (such as bold, italic, and underline) using a user-friendly text editor.

Categorization: Notes can be categorized into different topics or folders, allowing users to better organize their content.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific notes by keywords, titles, or tags.

User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) will be provided for users to interact with the application. The GUI should include buttons, menus, and text areas for creating, editing, and managing notes.

File Persistence: Notes and user data will be saved locally using file storage. Serialization can be used to save and load notes.

Formatting Options: Implement a set of buttons or formatting shortcuts that users can use to apply formatting options to selected text in the note editor.

Responsive Design: Design the applicationâ€™s GUI to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring that it works well on different screen sizes.

Data Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that users enter valid data when creating or editing notes.
